# Tree_Eigenvalues
Software for computing eigenvalues and related distributions for regularly branching trees.

The current version contains Sage code for three basic tasks: constructing trees, computing their eigenvalues, and displaying the eigenvalue plots. 

There are is also code for generating simplicial versions of these objects and an @interact tool for computing the endpoints of the limiting distribution for regular trees. 

These tools were developed for exploratory purposes - more polished versions are in development.
